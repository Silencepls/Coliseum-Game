# Coliseum-Game

My first game made in less than one week for a gamejam in about feb 2022

The theme of the jam was: Foddian.
A Foddian game is generally unforgiving, has no real checkpoints, and has a constant threat of losing huge chunks of progress.

This game was ment to be hard and as my first game, even with bad practices, it was very satisfying finishing a project.

You can give it a try on: https://s1lenceplease.itch.io/coliseum

The game has 10 levels, when you defeat a enemy it can drop items and each level increases the difficulty.

Ps: Even I couldn't beat it XD good luck.
